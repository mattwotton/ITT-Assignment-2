      <h1 class="">Robots</h1>

      <h2>What does it do?</h2>

      <p>Robots are computer programmed machines capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically (Oxford University Press 2019). Robots can take any number of forms but are usually designed to perform a task with no regard to their aesthetics. Presently there are two main types of robot, general-purpose autonomous robots and dedicated robots. General-purpose robots can be used for different tasks whilst dedicated robots are used for a specific purpose. General-purpose robots can be used for many different tasks and have a broad range of applications. Much like computers, robots can be connected to networks, software and accessories to increase their function and usefulness. Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous, where humans have some input over the outcome of the robot’s actions.</p>

      <h3>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</h3>

      <p>Boston Dynamics is a US company that makes advanced robots that incorporate machine learning routines and algorithms (Boston Dynamics 2019). Their currently line up of robots focus on data capture, inspection and warehousing tasks. Boston Dynamics have recently released a video of their robots dancing which demonstrates their robot’s ability to closely mimic the movements of humans (Boston Dynamics 2020).
      </p>

      <p>NASA’s Mars Rovers have been sent to Mars and have been used to collect data from Mars and beam it back to us on Earth (mars.nasa.gov n.d.). The Perseverance rover is about the size of a car and is packed with a computer module, sensors, cameras, microphones and communication equipment. It can also drill into the surface to collect samples of rocks and soil to store. The samples are then left of the surface for later collection by future missions with the hope that they can be returned to Earth for laboratory analysis.</p>

      <h3>What can be done now?</h3>

      <p>Robots can be found performing tasks in many environments and industries. In factories, robots are used on production lines to perform repetitive tasks with greater speed, efficiency and precision than a human. In electronics manufacturing, robots are used to quickly and reliably solder components onto printed circuit boards.
      </p>

      <p>Robots can be used to replace humans in dangerous and inaccessible environments like those found underground, in outer space, on other planets and the moons that orbit them. The Mars Rover, created by NASA, has beamed back images of the planet’s surface and data of its composition, and robots orbiting the planet collect data to provide information on what the planet’s atmospheric composition.</p>

      <p>In situations where there is a danger or threat to human life, robots can be sent in to assist with tasks like dismantling bombs and landmines (Ackerman 2014). In mining, robots can be used to assist with excavation and detection of dangerous gases. Abandoned mines can also be explored by robots without the need for a human to enter a site that may collapse on them (Joshi 2020).</p>

      <p>Around the home, robots can be used to perform dull and repetitive tasks such as vacuuming, mopping floors, mowing the lawn, cleaning gutters and window cleaning. Robots have also been used for toys and as entertainment devices since the 1980s (Bonnier Corporation 1984).
      </p>

      <h3>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</h3>

      <p>Over the coming years, the application of autonomous robots is expected to increase rapidly with home robotics and autonomous vehicles being a couple of the main drivers (Forecasts | Driverless car market watch 2017). As technologies like computer vision and language processing are developed and improved, robots will become more intelligent and able to carry out a wider range of more sophisticated tasks.
      </p>

      <h3>What technological or other developments make this possible?</h3>

      <p>Robots are comprised of the combination of pre-existing technologies such as cameras, sensors, mechanical parts, and computer hardware and software which comprise the controller, or 'brain' of the robot (https://www.howstuffworks.com/ 2002).
      </p>

      <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
      <h3>What is the potential impact of this development?</h3>
      <h3>What is likely to change?</h3>
      <h3>Which people will be most affected and how?</h3>
      <h3>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h3>

      <p>The robots developed by companies such as Boston Dynamics have the potential to replace large numbers of warehouse staff who pick and pack orders and manage stock inventories. Robots such as autonomous vehicles have the potential to replace the staff currently required to operate logistics businesses, taxi and public transport services. Although robots may replace the functions performed by humans it is predicted that robots aren’t likely to be responsible for large numbers of job losses. For example, Amazon has been able to implement robots in its distribution centres whilst retaining their human employees (Amazon 2019).
      </p>

      <p>As robots and automated systems take up less space than traditional models that require access for humans, warehouses can be built on premises that would have previously been considered too small. It is feasible that warehouses such as these will benefit from the efficiencies gained through other robot operated services such as autonomous vehicles. This will likely lead to an increase of robot operated distribution centres that manage receipt and delivery of goods, decreasing the wait time for consumers to receive their deliveries and increasing customer satisfaction.
      </p>

      <p>The reduction in human labour has cost saving benefits like ongoing wages, sick and annual leave. Implementing robots for heavy lifting and manual handling duties mitigates the risk of injury to humans and the negates the loss of productivity required for recovery time. As robots don’t get tired, production and services can be run around the clock. The main ongoing cost for businesses would then shift to monitoring, and regular maintenance of the robots. These cost savings will have a great impact on profits for those running the businesses and their shareholders but will negatively impact those who may be made redundant by the robot workforce. The reduction of repetitive jobs will inspire the population to take on more skilled roles, providing those people with a greater sense of job satisfaction (Sutton 2020). This will hopefully lead to a more productive society as workers will be more engaged with their work.
      </p>

      <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
      <h3>In your daily life, how will this affect you?</h3>
      <h3>What will be different for you?</h3>
      <h3>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h3>

      <p>The benefits of having robots perform menial tasks will provide people more time to spend with their families or doing things that are more important to them. The increase in available time will provide people the chance to pursue goals and opportunities that may have been hindered by other commitments and responsibilities such as domestic chores. As the technologies that operate the robots gets more advanced, it’s likely that there will be less need for humans to trigger the robots to perform a task as they’ll be able to detect when the task should be completed. If robot vacuums and similar technologies develop to the point where they are self-cleaning and can dispose of waste without the need for human intervention, the very thought of completing certain types of housework will become a thing of the past.
      </p>

      <p>People with disabilities, and the elderly will be able to live more independently as the requirement for others to assist them will be reduced and outsourced to a robot assistant or automated service. The ability of these people to navigate the world unassisted can bring them improved quality of life by granting them access to the outside world and more options for leisure and recreation. In some cases, robots may become human companions for these people, serving to alleviate the negative symptoms associated with depression and loneliness, or enhancing the lives of those who have limited opportunity to socialise.
      </p>

      <p>In my line of work, I am required work close to traffic and often on main thoroughfares. Having a robot that could play a part in setting up a site, performing a simple task such as positioning traffic cones, would significantly reduce my exposure to dangers posed by being around fast-moving vehicles (Glaskin 2004). The benefit of having a robot that can be replaced cannot be overstated, as each of us as humans are irreplaceable.
