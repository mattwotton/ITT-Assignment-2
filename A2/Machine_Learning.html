      <h1 class="">Machine Learning</h1>

      <h2>What does it do?</h2>

      <p>Machine Learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data (Mitchell 2019). The algorithms are fed a batch of sample data which trains the algorithm to make classifications, decisions or predictions without being programmed to do so. This process produces what is called an ML system or ‘model’. This model can then be fed new data that the system can learn from and in turn create more accurate classifications, decisions and predictions (IBM Cloud Education 2020). ML is often seen as a path towards Artificial Intelligence (AI); however, for a data scientist, statistician or business user ML can be a powerful tool for making accurate and actionable predictions about your products, customers, marketing efforts, or any number of other applications (Iliya Valchanov 2018). ML has two main objectives, to classify data based on developed models and to make predictions for future outcomes based on those models.</p>

      <h3>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</h3>

      <p>In Healthcare, ML is being used in cancer prediction and prognosis and to predict the best combination of drugs to kill cancer cells (Aalto University 2020). This is part of a wider trend towards personalising treatments to individuals (Cruz & Wishart 2007). ML algorithms can also assist with processing and managing large amounts of patient data, increasing efficiency within clinics and hospitals (Olive n.d.).
      </p>

      <p>One of the more recent developments in ML are General Adversarial Networks (GAN). These algorithms can be used to generate image datasets, human faces, cartoon characters, translate text-to-image, translate image-to-text, 3D object generation (OpenAI n.d.). A recent breakthrough in GAN application is deepfake. Deepfakes are images or videos that can be created through deep learning ML algorithms (Shen et al. n.d.). Although Deepfakes can create videos for entertainment purposes, they also raise ethical and moral concerns as they have the potential to deceive viewers through the use of misinformation.
      </p>

      <p>Reinforcement Learning is a type of ML where desirable behaviours are rewarded, and non-desirable behaviours are cast aside. Reinforcement Learning seeks to maximise rewards in an environment or given situation. Some examples of reinforcement learning techniques are the neural evolution ML algorithm MarI/O (SethBling 2015) and the OpenAI hide-and-seek game (Baker 2019).</p>

      <p>In both of these systems, the ML algorithm knows nothing or very little about how to interact with its environment or what rules determine a successful outcome. In the case of MarI/O, a ‘fitness’ parameter measures the ability of the algorithm to move the player to the right of the screen without dying, thereby completing the level. As the level is replayed, the algorithm refines the moves it can make to complete the level whilst also trying to improve it’s ‘fitness’. After 24 hours of replaying the level, the algorithm is able to complete the level in a manner that a human would struggle to match. In the OpenAI hide-and-seek game, two teams of agents are given the task to either avoid the line of sight of the other team or to keep the hiding team in their sight. Throughout the course of millions of simulations each team was able to develop more complex behaviours from a simple initial instruction.
      </p>

      <h3>What can be done now?</h3>

      <p>Amazon uses ML to recommend products based on your purchase history, in a similar fashion, Netflix uses ML to recommend shows and movies based on your viewing history (Arora 2016). These recommendation tools are built using a technique called matrix factorisation (Ye 2020).
      </p>

      <p>Digital assistants like Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri use ML to process requests and refine their ability to understand more complex requests as they are fed more information (Oracle n.d.). As the assistants learn more about you and your habits, they are able to make better recommendations and predictions about your behaviour. In some cases, the digital assistant can initiate a conversation based on what it has learned about you to make a recommendation.
      </p>

      <p>Household products such as robot vacuums are gaining increased functionality through integration with digital assistants and by utilising more advanced software that integrates ML (Vincent 2020). Robot vacuums have the ability to identify different pieces of furniture and to create a map of your home. Users can then label sections of the map with an appropriate name and then issue a command to a digital assistant such as “clean under the table in the bedroom”.</p>

      <p>ML also plays an important role in autonomous vehicle systems. The ability for onboard cameras and sensors to detect obstacles and other vehicles are reliant on ML processes such as objection detection (Ors 2020).
      </p>

      <h3>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</h3>

      <p>The future of ML is likely to be in the refinement of currently existing technologies like autonomous vehicles, digital assistants, search engine results, and recommendation tools (Pickell 2019). The ability to implement ML algorithms is becoming increasingly easier with the creation of “no-code” environments. Anyone wanting to add ML features and functionality can do so by downloading open-source ML frameworks and following short user-friendly tutorials to get started.
      </p>

      <h3>What technological or other developments make this possible?</h3>

      <p>Machine learning is partly based on a model of brain cell interaction. The model was created in 1949 by Donald Hebb (Foote 2019). ML has relationships to other fields of study such as computer science, data mining, mathematics, and statistics. ML learning methods are best described as using a combination of linear and matrix algebra and their behaviours can be understood using tools associated with probability and statistics (Brownlee 2013).
      </p>

      <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
      <h3>What is the potential impact of this development?</h3>
      <h3>What is likely to change?</h3>
      <h3>Which people will be most affected and how?</h3>
      <h3>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h3>

      <p>ML can replace humans in analysing large amounts of data. ML algorithms are able to perform analysis tirelessly, with greater efficiency than humans, and will provide more accurate predictions as they process more data. In some cases, there will still be some requirement for humans to supervise and approve the analysis performed by ML algorithms. This means there may be potential for data analysis roles to be created and to pivot more towards analysing the data output by ML models and algorithms.
      </p>

      <p>ML developments in Healthcare have the potential to affect everyone. The ability to obtain a diagnosis could mean the difference between life and death for some patients. As ML models get better at predicting different types of illness and disease, there is also the possibility that they can identify precursors in advance of symptoms appearing.
      </p>

      <p>As with most automation integration in the workforce, there is the potential that humans will be replaced for repetitive and simple tasks. As digital assistants become more advanced, there is the possibility that they could take phone calls, reschedule meetings and provide updates to those involved. The duties traditionally performed by secretaries and personal assistants would be outsourced to a digital assistant. Duties performed by cleaners could be entirely replaced by a workforce of ML equipped robots that can detect when cleaning is required. As the cost of manufacturing technology that incorporates ML decreases, the initial cost of purchase will be quickly offset by the ongoing costs associated with paying a human to perform the same tasks.
      </p>

      <p>Deepfake videos and images have the potential to be used for nefarious purposes. As the quality of deepfakes increases so does the likelihood that they will fool people. The relatively harmless application of such videos is as a means of parody for entertainment purpose. A possible worst-case scenario is the breakout of war based on a video of a leader or politician being made to incite a violent reaction.
      </p>

      <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
      <h3>In your daily life, how will this affect you?</h3>
      <h3>What will be different for you?</h3>
      <h3>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h3>

      <p>With ML being implemented in so many aspects of our lives the potential impact of this technology is huge. I think one of the biggest impacts will be seen in Healthcare. ML data management will free up staff from administrative duties allowing them to provide a higher level of service to patients. ML will aid doctors in identifying and diagnosing disease and in suggesting the best treatments for individuals. With ML models becoming more and more accurate, the potential for misdiagnosis is reduced.
      </p>

      <p>The evolution of digital assistants and recommendation systems will see them providing more personalised recommendations such as news and entertainment that is suited to our interests and tastes. As these systems learn more about our habits and behaviours, they can potentially provide reminders and suggestions without our input.
      </p>

      <p>With household cleaning technologies there is the possibility that coming to rely on these technologies may make people lazier as they expect machines and robots to perform all of their non-desirable tasks and duties for them. Ideally, use of ML will mean that we have more time for other activities and are able to free our minds of the need to remember when tasks and other duties are to occur.
