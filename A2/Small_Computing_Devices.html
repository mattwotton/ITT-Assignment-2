      <h1 class="">Small Computing Devices</h1>

      <h2>What does it do?</h2>

      <h4>Raspberry Pi</h4>

      <p>Raspberry Pis are small single-board computers. The devices were originally created with the intention of teaching computer science in schools and in developing countries (Raspberry Pi Foundation 2017). The initial run of Raspberry Pis was hugely successful and found many applications outside the intended purpose of education and robotics. Raspberry Pis have proved to be useful in a wide range of applications such as home automation, industrial automation and commercial products.
      </p>

      <p>In industrial and home automation settings, Raspberry Pis are connected to an Internet of Things (IOT) server and relays which can used to turn devices on or off or modify their behaviour. The user enters commands through the IOT interface which are sent to Rasperry Pi, the Raspberry Pi then executes the commands and communicates the updated device statuses back to the IOT platform.
      </p>

      <h4>Arduino</h4>

      <p>Arduino is an open-source software and hardware manufacturer. Arduino create single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices (Arduino 2019). Being an open-source project there is an active user community that design and build new devices using these technologies.
      </p>

      <h4>Makey Makey</h4>

      <p>Makey Makeys are an invention kit designed to connect everyday objects to computer keys. Makey Makeys use electrical signals to send either a keyboard stroke or mouse click signal to a computer (Chen 2016). This allows the Makey Makey to work with any computer program or webpage that accepts keyboard or mouse inputs. A kit is composed of a circuit board, USB cable.
      </p>

      <h3>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</h3>

      <p>Magic Mirror2 is an open-source smart mirror (Evans 2020). A screen is mounted behind a two-way mirror, mounted into a frame and is then be configured to display information based on a user’s preferences. In this way, the mirror can be used as a personal assistant, displaying useful information such as weather forecasts or your personal calendar with your upcoming events.
      </p>

      <h3>What can be done now?</h3>

      <p>All of these small computing devices can be used to create an almost endless number of different projects. The project ideas range from weird and wacky, to those that have everyday practical uses.
      </p>

      <h4>Raspberry Pi</h4>

      <p>One of the more popular and conventional uses for a Raspberry Pi, is as a web server to host a website. A great example of this is the Raspberry Pi Foundation’s official website, which is hosted on a cluster of Rasperry Pis (DevicePlus Editorial Team 2020).
      </p>

      <p>Raspberry Pis can be used to run video game emulators. As the Raspberry Pi hardware is more powerful than that of their arcade counterparts, they can be loaded with many more games than their predecessors. After installing them inside an old arcade machine cabinet and connecting them to a CRT monitor, they create convincing replicas of the gaming machines popular back in the 1980s and 1990s (Instructables 2018).
      </p>

      <h4>Arduino</h4>

      <p>Arduino project examples include a fidget spinner rpm counter (Baranov 2017). This project uses a hall effect sensor which measures the magnitude of a magnetic field. A magnet is attached to one arm of the fidget spinner for the sensor to detect when a rotation is completed.
      </p>

      <p>Another interesting project uses brainwaves to fly a drone (Tony 2021). As the creator of the project states, the execution of control is a little unpredictable, however, there is potential for this experiment to be applied to other applications such as turning lights on and off.
      </p>

      <h4>Makey Makey</h4>

      <p>One interesting use I’ve found using a Makey Makey or similar device is using a Pink Oyster Mushroom to play a modular synthesizer (MycoLoco 2020). Electrical resistance is measured by running a small current through the mushroom, these measurements are then converted into control voltages which determine various parameters on the synthesizer such as rhythm and pitch.
      </p>

      <h3>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</h3>

      <p>There will be an increase in projects that use machine learning algorithms, as future iterations of the Raspberry Pi are likely to include a processor designed for low power machine learning applications (Pounder 2021). The improvements to Raspberry Pis will enhance the capability of Arduinos, as they will support communication with the new Raspberry Pi processors (Pounder 2021b).
      </p>

      <h3>What technological or other developments make this possible?</h3>

      <p>These small computing devices rely on computing hardware and software. Advances in manufacturing processes allows them to have a small footprint and reduce their cost to consumers. As a real-world example, a Raspberry Pi has the same footprint as a credit card. Established protocols and modules such as RS-485 and ethernet, enable small computing devices to communicate with other devices and computers (Arduino 2019a) (Arduino 2019b).
      </p>

      <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
      <h3>What is the potential impact of this development?</h3>
      <h3>What is likely to change?</h3>
      <h3>Which people will be most affected and how?</h3>
      <h3>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h3>

      <p>As the application for such devices are limited only by a creator’s imagination, there is the possibility that someone can create something revolutionary not yet thought of. The Arduino project that uses brainwaves and focused attention could have uses in other areas, such as allowing people with mobility issues to interact and control other devices. Products like the Magic Mirror also demonstrate the potential of integrating computers with regular household items.
      </p>

      <p>Raspberry Pis can be implemented into industrial and home automation, the prevalence of industrial and home automation is likely to increase, particularly if they are integrated into ready to use commercial products. Small computing devices can also be used to prototype new products and bring them to the market in a shorter period of time as opposed to more traditional product development cycles (Alves 2019). The implementation of small computing devices in industry has the potential to increase operations efficiency by relying on the machines and additional sensors to take the place of humans performing monitoring tasks (Olson 2019). Having automated processes in place will allow humans to focus on other duties that are less suited to automated systems.
      </p>

      <p>The evolution of small computing devices sees them including more processing power as technology advances and the cost of producing components decreases. As the size of some components is reduced, there is the potential for more functions and features to be housed on the same size board or a reduction in the device size in lieu of extra functionality. For example, the current generation of Raspberry Pis are three times more powerful compared to earlier iterations of the device. With increases in processing power their application and usefulness increases, allowing them to be used in more situations where a dedicated PC or workstation would have been required.
      </p>

      <p>These technologies may make some jobs redundant, such as those where a human is required to monitor a device or piece of equipment. Having the ability to remotely monitor equipment may mean that jobs are created where a human is tasked with overseeing these devices perform their duties. As these devices have such a wide and wild scope of application, it’s difficult to determine how they may affect us in a specific way. Even with a small portion of the population being in possession of these devices, there is the possibility that new developments with these technologies can impact the entire population. I think that these devices will play a bigger role in enhancing our lives and increasing the efficiency of business operations than in replacing large numbers of people in the workforce.
      </p>

      <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
      <h3>In your daily life, how will this affect you?</h3>
      <h3>What will be different for you?</h3>
      <h3>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h3>

      <p>Integrating these small computing devices into home automation scenarios can have cost saving and efficiency benefits, as devices like lights, heating and cooling systems, can be turned off and on using sensors or a variety of triggers such as proximity and motion detection. Implementations such as this pave the way for additional safety benefits as navigating your way across a darkened room would become a thing of the past. Home security can be increased through integrating facial detection with door locks, only allowing people access to a premise only if their face matches those in a database (Maker Pro 2019). The interaction of these automations can further enhance efficiency, for instance a combination curtains, blinds or windows could be opened to not only adjust lighting but also adjust the temperature throughout the house.
      </p>

      <p>By having digital assistants appear in unconventional places such as mirrors, our minds can be freed of the requirement to commit upcoming events to memory and removes the need for us to confirm them by checking our phones or computers.
        Having the ability to remotely monitor, or setup devices that can detect when you’re not at home, could be a great way to avoid the anxiety inducing thoughts like “did I remember to turn the oven off” (BlueSpeedAV 2016). If that situation did occur, you could dismiss it knowing that it would be taken care of by an automated routine or deactivate the device through a web interface or smartphone application.
      </p>

      <p>For those who are less inclined to jump the hurdles to implementing automation using these small computing devices, existing products such as Google Home and Alexa may be preferable as they can communicate with an increasing number of smart home products (Google n.d.). As there is potential for these devices to be used to in a wide array of purposes in seemingly small ways, the sum of these small changes to our day to day lives through outsourcing tasks to automated process can have a large overall impact on our quality of life.
