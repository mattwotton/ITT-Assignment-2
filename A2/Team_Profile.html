          <h4 style="text-align:center;">BACKGROUND</h4>
          <br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">I currently work in Communications, building the multi-technology mess that is the National Broadband Network. I completed Year 12 in 2001 and studied Audio Engineering at SAE College in 2004. My audio engineering knowledge transferred well to learning how optic fibre networks operate. My hobbies include creating digital art, making music on my computer and playing video games. I try to maintain some level of fitness by making irregular visits to the gym. My interest in IT began through using gaming consoles, like the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and computers in my youth. I fondly recall playing Kid Icarus on my NES and adventure games such as Space Quest & Police Quest on an old PC. Although I still enjoying gaming, my interests now are more focused on using computers to build websites and for creative purposes such as art and music. My experience with IT is quite varied. In high school I learned touch typing which greatly increased my efficiency when performing tasks on computers. In my late teens I learned to build PCs, optimising the builds for the purpose of creating music. Recently, the company I work for launched another business focusing on digital signage and security systems. This involves integration of surveillance equipment and digital signage into existing networks and troubleshooting any issues that arise in the process. In a previous role, I used MS Excel for forecasting workloads and staffing requirements based off those forecasts. Learning and applying Excel formulas sparked my interest in coding and in turn web development. In 2015 I worked at a tech start-up where I was responsible for user acceptance testing, creating technical documentation, user guides, and video tutorials on how to use the product.</p>

                <br>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">The VARK test accurately sums up my preferred methods of learning as I generally prefer to learn by reading and then applying information. However, depending on the context, some other formats such as video can be much more suited to conveying the required information and also provide a demonstration at the same time. When working in a team I try to focus on what work needs to be done and how the team aims to complete it. I like to approach work in a methodical manner and believe this would assist the group in planning and assigning work. As an introvert I need to make an effort to make sure I’m contributing to the conversation. When working in a team I am happy to do whatever it takes to get the project completed and am not particularly fussy about what work I’m assigned to. I prefer that everyone has an equal portion of work to complete and are willing to help others if they complete work ahead of other team members.

           <br> <br>
            <h4>BACKGROUND</h4>
            <br>
             <p style="text-align: justify;">I have worked for the same company since 1997 and live with my two adult children in northern suburbs of Melbourne. I have lived in Melbourne all my life.
              <br>My hobbies include learning new things, reading, crosswords, <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=what+is+sudoku&qs=SS&pq=what+is+sudoku&sc=6-14&cvid=D6AC6EE5EF4941C7BFA0E8C80856F72A&FORM=QBRE&sp=1">sudoku</a> & card/board games.<br>
              <br>My interest in IT stems from the feeling and excitement I get from learning new things.  The very nature of technology is forever changing and evolving so it can never get boring.  You just cannot ever know ‘everything’.<br>
              <br>My experience in IT ranges from <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/d/dataentr.htm#:~:text=1.%20Data%20entry%20is%20the%20inputting%20of%20data,from%20forms%20or%20other%20non-electronic%20forms%20of%20data.">data entry</a> to <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/technical-lead">tech lead/implementation lead</a>, development, training delivery and project management (on a small scale). I have worn many hats since I joined the workforce back in the 80s and majority of the roles involved some form of computer interaction.<br>
              <br>My current role as an IT Implementation Lead involves coordinating with many different IT specialists and teams to implement the job for delivery to the customer. The specialist roles I engage with range from Developers, <a href="https://www.indeed.com/hire/c/info/what-does-a-business-analysts-do">Analysts</a>, <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/629/information-technology-architect-it-architect#:~:text=An%20IT%20architect%20is%20an%20individual%20that%20architects,architect%20is%20also%20known%20as%20an%20enterprise%20architect.">Architects</a>,

              <br>My strengths would have to be my Communication skills, Organisational skills and my enthusiasm for learning.  I believe with effort you can figure out most things.

              <p style="text-align: justify;">
              On review of my test outcomes, I think some of the key points that would be helpful for the team are:<br><br>
              <strong>Conscientiousness</strong> <em>(Big 5)</em> (Result: 87/100) – I agree 100%.  I care a lot about my work and how people see me.  I do not work well in a disorganised or haphazard environment, so usually end up organising everyone to help it work. <br><br>
              <strong>Dutiful and very responsible </strong> <em>(16 Personalities)</em> (Result – Logistician)– definitely take my responsibilities very seriously.  I do not like to let anyone down. <br>
              <strong>Honest & Direct</strong> <em>(16 Personalities) (Result – Logistician) </em>– can be misconstrued as blunt or insensitive. I work on this aspect and work on filtering my first thoughts into a more presentable way so that it does not come across as blunt or insensitive.<br><br>

              I would think the above results will show the group that I can be relied upon to not only do my share but always aim to deliver what is required in a timely manner.  I am not one to leave things to the last minute or procrastinate.<br><br>
              In regard to the Honest & Direct feedback, although I can agree that it might be part of my personality profile, it is not something that is a huge issue in my daily life.  When I was younger I was probably a bit more prone to speaking out without thinking.  In my wisdom, I have found much better ways to communicate and work really well in a team environment. <br><br>
              In relation to the learning style, it would be more beneficial for the group to understand that I learn better and engage better when I see or do something.  So explaining an issue verbally is not always helpful to me.  (This conflicts with the results that state I learn mainly by hearing and doing)<br>

          <br> <br>
          <h4>BACKGROUND</h4>
          <br>
             <p style="text-align: justify;">I am a mother to three daughters and married to a System Engineer, who has his own business. He concentrates on managing client’s servers
                and I.T networks for their business’s, also he does contract work for the state government and ambulance Victoria. My goal is to achieve enough knowledge to feel confident
                enough to be able to assist my husband to allow him to grow his business further. I have been a hairdresser for 14 years and have come from a family of hairdressers, so it came
                very naturally to me. As I mature, I regret not furthering my studies from my VCE but have decided it is not too late.  <br>

                Everything technology related interests me from biomedical engineering to autonomous cars to even cloud-based storage, especially for precious photos we accumulate.
                I feel technology is everywhere from our navigation in our cars to our virtual assistants, google home. Using YouTube and Netflix has become even easier now being
                accessible via our remote controls and viewed on our smart TV’s.<a href=" https://www.insider.com/the-evolution-of-tvs-through-the-decades"> pg 1, Matthew Wilson, Jan 18, 2020, How TV has changed through the decades, 13/04/21</a> It is quite hard to escape technology in this day in age, its literally in the palm of our hands with
                our smartphones giving us access to the internet wherever we are.<a href=" https://saucelabs.com/blog/how-smartphones-and-mobile-internet-have-changed-our-lives"> pg 1, Posted Jan 12, 2016, How Smartphones and Mobile Internet Have Changed Our Lives, 13/04/21</a> It is simply amazing, and since starting this course it has opened my eyes to the possibilities that
                technology can create.  <br><br>

                We are quite tech savvy in our family, also having a husband in I.T has given me some knowledge about cloud computing, servers and managing business’s IT needs. I enjoy
                using social media to communicate with friends and family and using cloud-based apps such as Google photos to store photos and videos.<a href=" https://www.businessinsider.com/how-does-google-photos-work?r=AU&IR=T"> pg1, Devon Delfino Jun 28, 2019,'How does Google Photos work?': Everything you need to know about Google's photo storage app for iPhone and Android, 13/04/21</a> I love editing my photos to make
                them more appealing with altering the light, contrast, and shadows. I know how to do all basic functions of scanning, emails, using both windows and apple Mac PC’s and
                laptops. I am always eager to learn something new and this course has shown me that I only know a small percentage of what I.T is. Since starting Introduction to
                Technology, I am even more intrigued to learn and grow, and so far, I am really enjoying this course.  <br><br>

                In my spare time, (which does not occur these days) I love painting portraits or landscapes on canvas. I love learning new things and growing my knowledge. I love going
                to the beach, spending quality time with family and friends and having a laugh. I love having bonfires and roasting marshmallows with my kids. As much as I love technology
                 I like to disconnect sometimes and recharge.

                <p style="text-align: justify;">After reviewing my Personality test results, they show that I work well in groups, as the traits show.<br> <br>

                According to the <strong>DISC Assessment</strong>, I'm an <strong>Influence</strong> personality type which engages others and shares enthusiasm, inspires and
                persuades others. <br>

                According to <strong>16 personalities</strong>, I'm an <strong>ENFJ-T Turbulent Protagonist</strong>, I care about helping and connecting with others and rather
                cooperate then compete, I also have empathy for others and like deep conversations. <br>

                According to <strong> Personality Perfect</strong>, I am <strong>ENFJ-The Giver</strong>, I am influential, loyal, reliable, genuine, passionate, reflective, warm,
                caring and communicate well.  <br><br>

                I agree with these tests results and all these traits can help me be a good team member as I care about the wellbeing of everyone and want to work together to get the
                best result. I like motivating and encouraging my group members and I like to help them in any way I can, may it be to help organise or share ideas or simply show encouragement.
                I like to get the reassurance back from my group members that they are satisfied with my efforts, this also shows me that I need good communication between my group members.

         bread as it is very hands on and typically does not rely on machines such as dough moulders. I originally wanted to be a chef but found I was more suited to baking as a hot kitchen can be quite a stressful atmosphere.
         I love cooking at home and making homemade pizzas as it combines my two loves: cooking and making bread.
        <br><br>
         IT is an ever-evolving industry and what it is now is completely different to what
         it was 10 years ago. Our lives are affected by IT every day, whether it be our smart phones sending a notification
         to us sitting down in front of the TV watching Netflix. It’s this kind of innovation that interests me and what will come.
         I was initially interested in IT as a high school student while taking computing classes. However, as my life evolved and started
         new activities, my interest took a back seat to everyday life goals and needs.
        <br><br>
        My interest in IT has been re-sparked as I look to future proof my career and get out of the hospitality industry. I have no professional experience in IT outside of being an end user.</p>

                               <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>16Personalities - Assertive Entertainer.</b> I do love to dance and spontaneously break into song and I can adapt to any situation whether it be a positive, negative or an awkward situation. I believe my Assertive Entertainer personality helps by bringing a team together, as I am more often than not the one who can start a conversation with people no matter their age or background. I have also known for a long time that I have a quick wit and I am able to de-escalate stressful situations with my humour.<br><br>

I also recognise that as an Assertive Entertainer, I have a trait where I like to observe rather than speak. Doing this allows me to take in the information around me to better understand a situation and to formulate a more targeted response.<br><br>

<b>Learning Style - Tactile.</b> I’ve never been the type of person to learn by just remembering, I was never good at written exams or tests, but I always did well at practical applications. I believe this is why I’ve stayed in my career as a Baker for so long.<br><br>

As a Tactile learner I learn by doing first and by being hands-on and then by reading or seeing to validate what I have experienced.  I am more likely to dive headfirst into a project and if something breaks, I work my way backwards to see where I went wrong.<br><br>

<b>Big 5 - Extroversion.</b> Similar to my result as an Assertive Entertainer, I am outgoing and social. I like to talk, and I like to be involved. Again, this helps me in the ability to interact and get along with a wide range of people. If I feel there could be more energy within a room, I am more than likely the one to kick start the conversation.<br>

        <br> <br>
          <h4>BACKGROUND</h4>
          <br>
             <p style="text-align: justify;">Originally from Sydney, I’ve been lucky to benefit from quite a varied upbringing, being schooled in several countries before living in Scotland for most of my adult life.  I studied pharmacy after leaving school, graduating in 2005 before completing registration training, and passing the examination for registration.  After this I decided to work freelance as a locum in order to gain as much varied experience of the sector as I could. I was responsible for finding work, building a good reputation as well as managing my own schedule and accounts.  I really enjoyed the nature of this role, needing to adjust to new work environments and team members quickly in order to do my job while maintaining accountability and responsibility for my own work. Because I enjoyed it so much, after telling myself that I would do it for a year or so, I ended up continuing the role one and off for over ten years.  During this time I met my wife and we went on to have two children.
          <br><br>
         A few years after qualifying, personal events meant a change of scene and some spare time so I decided to study laws of international business, an area that interested me and that I thought a knowledge of would prove useful in future.  I thoroughly enjoyed this, especially competition and EU law, writing my master’s thesis on EU competition law, parallel trade and its impact on the pharmaceutical industry.  I had not intended that the degree would lead to any specific career change and although it has lead to some career opportunities.  I see its real value in having improved my evaluation of problems and resultant decision making meaning that what once would may have seemed overwhelming now appears achievable.  I had considered myself to be a critical thinker as I had completed a scientific degree but had now learnt another way to assess situations, identify relevant issues and solve problems.
         <br><br>
         Recently we accepted opportunity for our family to move back to Australia.  Registering as a pharmacist in Australia having UK qualifications is surprisingly difficult and there isn’t perhaps the demand for my skills as there was in Scotland.  Rather than spend time and money on this, I saw it as an opportunity give my career a steer in another direction.  I have been involved in a few projects related to IT which I had found very engaging and had always wondered about being able to improve on the systems with which I have worked. Having studied online before, I was confident I would have the self discipline to repeat this and knew that although it presents challenges, I value both its flexibility and portability.

          <br><br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">A few years ago, I undertook a Myers-Briggs test as part of a wider evaluation.  I was able to find the results and compare them to the test on 16personalities.  Interestingly, the results were quite different and I am left wondering whether knowing what the test outcome would likely be based on the questions influenced my answers.  Anyway, 16personalities has me down as <strong>INFJ</strong>, a diplomat who strives for constant improvement.  The test I had undertaken previously catogorised me as <strong>INTP</strong>, an <strong>independent problem solver</strong> who is likely to excel in <strong>detached concise analysis</strong> of a situation or problem.  So definitely introvert, something I have become more comfortable with since first taking a Meyers-Briggs test.
         <br><br>
         <p style="text-align: center;">learning style test results:<br><br>
      <i>  Education Planner:</i><br>
         Auditory: 45%<br>
         Visual: 15%<br>
        Tactile: 40%<br>
    <br>
    <i>Personality Max:</i><br>
        Kinesthetic -45%<br>
        Auditory – 40%<br>
        Visual – 15%<br>
        <br>
        The above results demonstrate that I’m not a particularly visual person which comes as no surprise to me.  In what I see I’m more interested in content than style but when it comes to hearing I think quite differently, often interpreting way in which something may have been said.  Because of this, I tend to ask for help with visual aspects of work.
        <br><br>
          Although Meyers-Briggs has me down as an introvert, I do enjoy <strong>teamwork</strong>. I’m aware that I can work in a seemingly disorganised manner but in fact I tend to group things in an unconventional way.  I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve had a colleague tell me they’ve done me the courtesy of tidying up the area I’m working in not realising that I then have to go back and re-create what they saw as mess in order to complete the job.  I did make a point of leaving the place tidy when I was done though.  I also feel that I work best under pressure, without this I can become distracted or tend to focus or become overly focused on a small detail.  I think that, while both of these attributes can work as strengths, I need to be able to adapt or curb them in order to be an effective team member.
