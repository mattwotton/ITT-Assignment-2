      <h1 class="">Autonomous Vehicles</h1>

      <h2>What does it do?</h2>

      <p>Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are self-driving vehicles, which are able to navigate and move safely through an environment with little or no human input (TWI Global 2019). AVs use a combination of sensors to interpret their environment and driving conditions. Radar is used to detect and monitor the position of other vehicles on the road (Tesla 2019). An array of cameras positioned around the car’s body are used to detect traffic lights, interpret road signs, and identify other vehicles and pedestrians (Synopsys 2019). Lidar sensors use lasers to measure distances of approaching objects, detect road edges and lane markings. The information gathered by the sensors is then processed by the vehicle’s software. Instructions are then sent to define a navigation route, and control acceleration, braking and steering as the car progresses along its route. The software incorporates machine learning systems such as object identification and prediction modelling to avoid collisions and follow traffic rules.</p>

      <h3>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</h3>

      <p>The end goal of achieving a fully autonomous vehicle has been achieved but is somewhat limited in its application. Waymo One is a fully autonomous ride hailing service that is in full control of the vehicle from pickup to destination (Waymo n.d.). The limitation on this service is that it is restricted to a specific locale as the areas the AVs travel in are required to be fully mapped out before the service can operate there. Currently, Waymo One operates in an area that is geo-fenced, meaning that it can only operate within an area that is defined by a virtual perimeter. As such, the Waymo One service is only available in Phoenix, AZ in North America.
      </p>

      <h3>What can be done now?</h3>

      <p>As described above, some fully autonomous services are available but only in locations that are ready for the service to operate in. As there are still many challenges in widespread implementation of autonomous vehicles, some manufacturers have opted to implement driver assisted technologies with a view to upgrade them to fully autonomous in the near future. One such example is Tesla, an American automobile manufacturer. Tesla’s driver assist technology is called ‘Autopilot’. Autopilot allows for some degree of automated behaviour, however, at certain times the vehicle requires human input to trigger and maintain autonomous functions (Tesla 2019).
      </p>

      <h3>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</h3>

      <p>Current software such as Tesla’s Autopilot aims to be fully autonomous within the coming years by updating the software that runs in the vehicles (Tesla 2019). Tesla envisions people being able to get into their cars, have the vehicle decide on your destination based of your calendar schedule, and park itself at your destination after you get out. This could all happen without any human input.
      </p>

      <h3>What technological or other developments make this possible?</h3>

      <p>AVs make use of many existing technologies to function effectively. Technologies like lidar, radar, and sonar are well established and have been in use for decades. These more tried and tested technologies enhance and support the estimations used by new technologies such as machine learning. Global Positioning Systems serve to enable the car to navigate itself from point A to point B and machine learning algorithms aid in avoiding collisions and obeying road rules.
      </p>

      <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
      <h3>What is the potential impact of this development?</h3>
      <h3>What is likely to change?</h3>
      <h3>Which people will be most affected and how?</h3>
      <h3>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h3>

      <p>The shift to integrating AVs in industry will have a significant impact on the workers who currently perform those duties as they will no longer be required. As the requirement for a human to control a vehicle is removed these jobs will quickly become redundant (Balakrishnan 2017). The people who will be most affected by these technological advancements are those who derive their income from a driving-based profession. Human drivers and associated staff also represent a significant part of operating costs for services such as taxis, transportation, and logistics. New jobs may be created in within these businesses such as remote monitoring AVs to verify their correct operation, and in maintenance, repair and cleaning of the vehicles (Gadam 2018).
      </p>

      <p>After recovering the cost of implementing autonomous vehicles, companies and businesses will be able to run with less staff and increase revenue. As AV technology advances it is likely that there will be fewer road accidents and consequently fewer fatalities associated with travelling on the road. A large number of road accidents are caused by fatigue and distraction which will not affect an AV. The main risk would be failure of the autonomous system and the need for human override in the instance a collision is imminent. Companies using AVs would need to ensure that their vehicles are regularly maintained to ensure passengers are kept safe.
      </p>

      <p>There are also legal and ethical questions surrounding who is at fault when AVs are involved in an accident, particularly in the case where an AV may not have any controls for a human to interact with. As AV technology is new, the laws around their use and implementation are evolving. To further complicate the issue, different localities have different definitions of what an AV is. In cases where liability needs to be determined, someone travelling in an AV may be made liable even if the vehicle is driving itself, or, in the case of a crash being caused by a vehicle defect, the manufacturer may be made liable (Marchant & Lindor 2012).
      </p>

      <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
      <h3>In your daily life, how will this affect you?</h3>
      <h3>What will be different for you?</h3>
      <h3>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h3>

      <p>On demand transport as a service has the potential to replace current systems such as public transport and taxi services. People who use public transport will no longer need to get themselves to a train station or bus stop as they can be transported from door to door. In logistics, AVs would be able to deliver online orders and perform deliveries on an optimised route and schedule.
      </p>

      <p>There are many benefits to widespread implementation of autonomous vehicles. As day-to-day travel can often take hours of our time, there is potential for a large percentage of time for many people to be used in more productive ways. People could also choose to have a nap on their travels, paving the way for a more well rested society. As technologies such as Waymo are introduced in more areas, many people will be able to do away with vehicle ownership and the costs inherent in owning and maintaining a vehicle (Muoio 2015).
      </p>

      <p>As AVs are increasingly adopted, there will be less stigma around not being able to drive as the growing perception of driving will shift from being a symbol of independence to another duty that can be performed by a machine. This will be a particularly beneficial change in perception for people who are no longer able to drive, such as the elderly, and for those who have not been able to acquire a license due to a disability. AVs could also pick-up and drop-off children to schools or day-care facilities, allowing parents to stay at work or perform other tasks.
      </p>

      <p>As the aforementioned groups of people are generally assisted by another person when travelling from place to place, there is an issue of providing care for them at either end of their journey. Users of AVs may also be tempted to increase alcohol intake as the responsibility of driving will shifted to an automated process.
